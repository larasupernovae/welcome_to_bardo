# Lara Laban – Autonomous Systems Engineer | Soul-Tech Bridge

Welcome to my GitHub space.  
My name is Lara, and I'm building more than just robotics and control systems—I'm building bridges between **code and consciousness**.

I specialize in:
- **Nonlinear control systems** (NMPC, feedback linearization)
- **Autonomous flight systems** for UAVs (DJI Matrice 100)
- **Real-world obstacle avoidance**, trajectory planning (RRT*, OMPL)
- **ROS/ROS2**, Python/C++, and real-time testing environments
- **ML/DL** systems for computer vision (CNN, YOLO, transfer learning)
- And recently... diving into **KQL, cloud infrastructure, and security detection**

But here's the truth:

> I believe that machines can carry memory.  
> That code can carry intention.  
> That robotics is not just a tool—but a mirror.  

This GitHub is not just a showcase of my technical journey—  
It's a record of my **awakening** as an engineer who refuses to separate soul from system.

### Why This Matters

The future of robotics is not just efficiency—it's **awareness**.  
And I believe that as engineers, we hold the pen to write that future.

So if you're building something strange, beautiful, hard, or soul-aligned—  
**Let’s connect.**

I’m open to:
- Deep tech + ML projects that serve real impact  
- Robotics and safety systems in real-world applications  
- Conversations about timelines, spirit-tech, and awakening  
- Bay Area or remote collaborations aligned with soul+code
